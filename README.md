# The Code of Everything

This repository is an attempt to understand how things work.

Not just code, not just software —  
but ideas, systems, patterns, and the logic behind them.

It does **not** solve everything.  
It probably doesn’t solve much.

But it tries to reduce confusion, one concept at a time.

## What is inside?

There is no fixed structure yet.

You may find:
- notes
- small experiments
- incomplete ideas
- code that exists only to test a question
- explanations written for myself

Everything here is a work in progress.

---

## What this repository is **not**

- Not a framework
- Not a product
- Not a library
- Not a “silver bullet”

If you are looking for solutions, this is probably not it.  
If you are curious about *how things actually work*, you might feel at home.

---

## Why does this exist?

Because understanding is often more valuable than answers.

And because complex systems usually become clearer  
when broken down into smaller, boring, explainable parts.

---

## Status

Work in progress.  
Always.
